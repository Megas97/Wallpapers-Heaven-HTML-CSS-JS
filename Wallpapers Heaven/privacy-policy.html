				    <p><b>PRIVACY NOTICE</b></p>
					<p><i>Last updated: January 12, 2020</i></p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p>
						This privacy policy applies to all Wallpapers Heaven users worldwide. For users in the European Economic Area (EEA) 
						and in Switzerland, Wallpapers Heaven complies with the principles of the U.S.-EU Privacy Shield Program and the 
						U.S.-Swiss Privacy Shield Program, and participates in both programs. Under both programs, we are subject to the 
						investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission, and we are liable for the unauthorized 
						transfer to third parties of user personal data. For more information, see https://www.privacyshield.gov. 
						To contact us regarding privacy issues, you can email us at wallpapersheaven@gmail.com, or snailmail us at 
						Wallpapers Heaven, Inc., 21 Montevideo St., Ovcha Kupel 2.
					</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p><i><u>Information we collect and the purposes for which we use it</u></i></p>
					<p><i>Automatically collected information</i></p>
					<p>
						Our servers automatically collect the following information regarding devices that access our site: 
						device characteristics (including device ID for mobile devices), operating system, browser type, IP address, 
						username from stored cookies if present, dates and times of each login, page and image viewing statistics, and 
						incoming and outgoing links. We also log the metadata associated with any uploaded images. We use this 
						automatically collected anonymous data to analyze how our site is used so as to keep it optimized, to determine 
						the popularity and usefulness of various features. We also use such data to enable us to comply with copyright 
						law, with 18 USC §2258A (illegal content), and to respond to lawful requests by public authorities, including 
						national security, courts, and law enforcement.
					</p>
					<p>
						None of this information is “personal data” – that is, data we could use to identify a specific person. Some of 
						this information could, however, become personal data because we provide automatically collected anonymous data to 
						third party advertisers to supplement the tracking information described below, and those third parties might be 
						able to combine our anonymous data with other data they have to enable them to identify people.
					</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p><i>Interactively collected information</i></p>
					<p>
						In addition to the automatically collected anonymous data described above, we may place information on your device 
						and then retrieve it later: we may use cookies, web beacons, or other anonymous tracking information to improve 
						our server's interaction with your device. We also partner with third party advertisers who may 
						(themselves or through their partners) place and/or recognize cookies on your device that collect data about 
						which pages and ads are viewed while our app or site is being used. Advertiser cookies enable customized ads that 
						are selected for display on your device based on the anonymous information collected. No personal data is on, 
						connected to, or derivable from, these cookies. If you block or disable cookies and other tracking technologies, 
						instead of getting customized ads you will see non-customized (generic) ads. Although our servers currently don't 
						respond to "do-not-track" requests, you can block tracking in other ways. If you would like more information about 
						this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies for interest 
						based advertising, please see the section below, "Accessing, correcting, and limiting use of your data".
					</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p><i><u>Accessing, correcting, and limiting use of your data</u></i></p>
					<p>
						Because we don’t collect information about the identity of our users and don’t receive any information from 
						third parties enabling us to identify our users, we have no means of knowing, or providing you with information 
						about, whatever anonymous data about you we might have on our servers.
					</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p><i><u>Data Protection</u></i></p>
					<p>
						We take every reasonable precaution to protect the data on our servers from loss, misuse, unauthorized access, 
						disclosure, alteration, or destruction, taking into account the risk level and the nature of the data. 
					</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p><i><u>Changes to this Privacy Policy</u></i></p>
					<p>
						We may revise our privacy policy from time to time by posting the changes here. You can determine the date of the 
						most recent changes by looking at the "Last updated" at the top.
